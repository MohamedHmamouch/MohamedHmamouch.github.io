If you've stumbled upon my GitHub profile, then you've found someone with a fiery passion for data science and information systems. My name is HMAMOUCH Mohamed, and I'm currently a final year engineering student at Ecole des Mines d'Albi in France. I thrive on the challenge of analyzing complex data sets and using them to make strategic decisions that optimize results. That's why I'm dedicating my career to this dynamic field. With a strong work ethic and determination to succeed, I am eager to bring my skills and enthusiasm to a full-time position.

Summary of my Experiences
======
During my academic journey, I had the opportunity to gain practical experience through two impactful internships as a data scientist. In my first internship at EDF (Électricité de France), I worked on challenging projects related to object detection in nuclear power plants. Using open-source models such as YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and AWS Rekognition, I developed solutions to enhance the efficiency and safety of nuclear operations. Additionally, I worked on image classification using spectral analysis with wavelet scattering transform, further expanding my knowledge and skills in the field.

In my second internship, I focused on time series analysis, specifically predicting quantities for raw materials. I explored various techniques such as ARIMA, SARIMAX, and LSTM to develop accurate forecasting models. This experience honed my expertise in handling time-dependent data and provided valuable insights into optimizing resource allocation and supply chain management.

My GitHub profile showcases my dedication to continuous learning and exploration in the field of data science. Through various projects and contributions, I have demonstrated my ability to apply cutting-edge techniques, collaborate effectively, and deliver impactful solutions.
